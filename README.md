Team Name: Music Taste

Project Description:
  Harmony is a site offering a community for music-lovers to connect and create with others. Form a User Profile through either our standard sign-up feature or sign in with Google Authentication to join our community and connect with others. Once youâ€™re signed in, you can create public blog posts about your favorite songs, albums, and artists to share your feelings and spark discussions, or you can create public collaborative playlists and invite your friends to add songs or pictures to curate unique experiences together.
  
User Roles:
  Registered User: A standard user has access to a customizable user profile and has the capability to create and contribute to collaborative playlists, as well as create and edit public blog posts.
  Unregistered User: A user without a registered account has the ability to view public blogs and playlists.
