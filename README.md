# project-t07-musictaste

Team Name: Music Taste (subject to change)

Project Description:
  GV: social app to connect people through music taste
  More realistic vision: supports daily music dump for social groups, provide
    Spotify account data analysis. Perhaps tailor the app for UCSB students.
    (more to come during storytime)
  Our project is going to be a music dump webapp where users can track the music they've listened to, similar to a diary where they can share on the profile their listens and their listening history. It will also have a collaborative playlist feature which allows users to make playlists with their friends and introduces a tiered permission system to make changes to the playlist, similar to discord. 
  
User Roles:
  Standard User: A standard user would have access to a customizable user profile and have the capability to create and contribute to collaborative playlists.
