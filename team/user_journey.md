Extremely Rough User Journey:
(will be discussed and refined further during storytime,
  which we will be holding this weekend Oct 9-10)

- What is the series of events that occur, in chronological order?
(sample events which are subject to change and will likely be changed
  this weekend!)
** Event 1: User onboarding. User creates an account in the web app and
    authorizes their Spotify account.
** Event 2: User updates their user profile with a picture and a custom status
    based on a song, album, artist, or lyric.
** Event 3: User follows their friends.
** Event 4: User creates a "music dump." User adds songs to the music dump
    with the option of accompanying the songs with comments or messages.
** Event 5: User shares the music dump with friends and toggles their read/
    write privileges.
** Event 6: User accesses a music dump that has been shared with them and
    contributes to it.
** Event 7: User exports the music dump to their Spotify account (as a
    playlist).
** More to come!
