Extremely Rough User Journey:
(will be discussed and refined further during storytime,
  which we will be holding this weekend Oct 9-10)

- What is the series of events that occur, in chronological order?
(sample events which are subject to change and will likely be changed
  this weekend!)
** Event 1: Music dump for social groups to share music with each other.
  (how do we differ this from Spotify's collaborative playlist function?)
  (Karanveer's idea)
** Event 2: "Tinder" swiping - user swipes left or right on songs (Brandon's
  idea)
** Event 3: User is presented with comprehensive listening data, which can
  be compare to other users' data. Data is presented in visual form and can
  be saved and posted to social media apps. (Laszlo's idea)
** Event 4: User can update their status with a song, lyric, etc. (Laszlo's
  idea)
** More to come!
