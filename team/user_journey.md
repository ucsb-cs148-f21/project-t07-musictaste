Step 6: Discuss the User Journey
As a team, discuss the “user journey” for your proposed application.

That is, try to describe all of the events that lead someone to seek out your product and have an interaction with it, or perhaps a series of interactions.

There should be a beginning, a middle and an end, where value is exchanged:

the user came with a goal, need, or desire, and
that goal was met, that need was satisfied, or that desire was fulfilled.
Identify:

What is that goal, need or desire?
What is the series of events, in chronological order?
Discuss this with your group, and capture (perhaps in a Google Doc?) whatever comes to mind.

The beginning of your user journey is a Problem Scenario as discussed in class, which is basically a short story, involving a subset of the concrete Personas you came up with in assignment h02 and expressing what the people eventually will want to achieve with your product and what the problem is with current solutions.

Beyond the problem scenario, you can document the design of your user journey in free form.

At this stage, it is important to get the ideas flowing. There is no specific “right or wrong” way to get your ideas down on paper (or, rather, eventually, a GitHub markdown file). Just write something that captures the group consensus, or the candidate proposals, for the “user journey”.

It can take any form: a list, or pictures, a collection of As a __ I can __ so that __ type stories, or any combination of those. Don’t get bogged down on what form it takes. Just get something down.

NOTE: Try to keep your description VERY HIGH LEVEL, avoiding specific implementation details.

Good: User selects a beverage from among several choices
Too much detail: User clicks on a drop down menu; each beverage has an image which flashes with an animation as you hover over it, etc. etc.
You don’t have to do this “perfectly” the first time. You may need to first get it all out as “brain dump” that contains too much detail, and then move to a higher level. But get to the higher level as soon as you can.

Don’t move on to the next step until you have the “spine” of your customer journey captured in some fashion.

You’ll know you have it, and you are ready for this step when:

It tells a coherent story. You can describe this to any reasonable person (e.g. a UCSB student that isn’t in this class, particularly one that might be a target user) and they will be able to follow what you are saying.
None of your “spine” should be “implementation” focused. It shouldn’t depend, for example, even on whether it happens to be a webapp, or a mobile app, or even an app at all. It shoudn’t depend on technology specifics.

The value exchange part is clearly identified: the goal/need/desire of the user, and how that gets acheived/met/fulfilled
Graded: (20) You earn these points if/only if:

your group produced a problem scenario in the form of a github file ‘./team/problem_scenario.md’, and
a user journey documentation in the format of your choice. Summarize what you came up with in a file ‘./team/user_journey.md’
