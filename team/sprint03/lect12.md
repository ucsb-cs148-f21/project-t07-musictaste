Type of meeting: Daily Scrum + Storytime

Team: Brandon Son [], Karanina (Laszlo) Zim [], Karanveer (KB) Benipal [], Kevin Tran []

Scribed Discussion:

Reviewed last week's progress with test development.
Feedback from Brandon and KB: Automated test development was extremely difficult and there was a LOT of roadblocks.

Team:

Brandon: developed Jest unit test

Laszlo: developed higher level testing, fixed Kanban board formatting

KB: developed user authentication integration test

Kevin: fixed Heroku deployment (there were some bugs during the MVP)

Feature idea:
- User community group that dictates the explore page (this would require a restructuring of app to base it around community groups)

Storytime (kind of): discussing most important upcoming tasks
- lots of implementation progress
- comments on blog posts
- authorization and blog privileges
- playlist dump:
    - page (frontend and pagination/routing)
    - link to database
- spotify api stuff:
    - song search dropdown?
    - export playlist?
