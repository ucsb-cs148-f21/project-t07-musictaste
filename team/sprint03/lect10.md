**Scribed Discussion:**

Biggest priorities for this week:
- fix heroku deployment
- develop unit testing for user authentication
- develop unit testing for user profile page

Backend pair discussion:
- database: set up user database (connect to user profile)
    - "as a user I want to log into my user profile and have recent changes be reflected (no hard code) so that my user profile remains up to date"

Misc.
- "as a user I don't want other users to be able to delete my diary posts so that I can have control over my posts and information"
- "as a user I want to be able to comment on other's diary posts and have others comment on my diary posts so that I can interact with other users"
