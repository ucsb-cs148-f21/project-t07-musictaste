Type of meeting: Retro #2

**Scribed Discussion:**
- sprint recap: finished mvp. current state of app: email and google authentication, explore page (blog post functionality), user profile (hard coded playlists)
- plan for next meeting as group: storyboarding, sprint planning, and planning how to integrate testing

**Team:**

Brandon: roommate contact traced, so waiting 

Laszlo: 
- brainstorming upcoming action items:
    - figure out deployment
    - standardizing styles
- resolved local git conflicts (hopefully i think)

KB: not feeling well

Kevin: alarm didn't work

**Retro Template:**

(we ended up holding a makeup retro on Monday Nov 1 when everybody was present)

Led by: Laszlo
Present: Brandon, Laszlo, KB, Kevin
Absent: n/a

_start_:
- research ideas BEFORE meeting, not an efficient use of time to flesh out fledgling ideas DURING meeting times
- pairworking (frontend and backend pairs)

_stop_:

_continue_:
- meeting up in person to work on the project together -> designate a weekly meeting, Mondays beginning next week

_additional notes_: good job everybody for finishing the MVP and being voted honorable mention!

**Retro Assessment:**
We used the start, stop, continue template. The retro went well and we agreed on tangible action items to implement in our development process for the next sprint. I think future retro leaders will find it easy to work with the team. Reminding the team of the template categories (start, stop, continue) is a good way to keep the discussion on track.
