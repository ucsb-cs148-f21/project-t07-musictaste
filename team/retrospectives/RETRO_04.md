Scribed Discussion:

Team:

(general thoughts)
- we all fully immersed ourselves into this project the last week and a half,
- we were all very involved; we were communicating frequently and spent quite a few late nights together
- we were really focused right up to the code freeze
- we all had a lot we still wanted to accomplish and it felt a little bittersweet having to stop so suddenly while we were on a role
- we would like to continue this project in the future and we already know where to start
- everybody had a gratifying quarter working on the project together and we are proud of what our project looks like so far

start:
- factoring a significantly larger amount of time for styling because that stuff is difficult and time consuming
- factoring time for the "little things" (like loose ends and corners, edge cases, small bugs etc) because they take longer than you'd expect AND they add up real fast

stop:
- we could not think of anything for this category

continue:
- meeting together physically and staying connected on Discord, sending frequent updates on work
- working synchronously
- debugging together, even if its something that doesn't concern anyone else's code and is specifically related to your responsibilities

Retro Assessment: we used the start, stop, continue template. We had a smooth and effective retro to wrap up a long, exhausting week and the team was able to share their thoughts about the culmination of the quarter.
