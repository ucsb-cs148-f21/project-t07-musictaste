# Retro #3 <date>

* Led by: Brandon
* Present: Kevin, KB, Laszlo, Brandon
* Absent: 

## Action item

* a goal: Get better at working together on the same components
* a change: Delegate less work to be done separately and delegate more work and time to working together in pairs or as a group
* a measurement: Keep track of which components are collaborative work

## Retro Assessment

* We covered what we did that we should continue doing, what we did that didn't work, and then what we will change in the next sprint.
* We agreed that our teamwork has been getting better, but we still have to iron out how to work together as a cohesive team when working on the same components together at the same time.
* The change made during Retro 02 to meet in person more definitely helped our productivity and teamwork, perhaps the most out of any habit we've adopted.
