# Retro #3 <date>

* Led by: Brandon
* Present: Kevin, KB, Laszlo, Brandon
* Absent: 

## Action item

* a goal: Get better at working together on the same components
* a change: Delegate less work to be done separately and delegate more work and time to working together in pairs or as a group
* a measurement: Keep track of which components are collaborative work

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* A brief statement on how much any of the Retros changed the way you worked as a team (no correct answer here. 
  Teams could be happy with the way they started operating from the get-go and Retrospectives would just be quick 
  confirmations then, or teams could have tried a lot of different things based on their retro reviews. We just would like to know!)
