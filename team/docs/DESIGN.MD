# Software Architecture
Our application utilizes the MERN stack:
MongoDB
Express.js
React
Node.js
MongoDB is the database provider which our backend, utilizing Express.js and Node.js, communicates with. Our frontend application utilizing React communicates with the backend and provides a user interface for users to interact with.

# Design Process
Our team decided on the MERN stack because we wanted to maintain the same language throughout our backend and frontend, and the MERN stack stays consistent with javascript utilized across the backend and frontend.
