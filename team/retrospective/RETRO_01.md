# Date of Retrospective: 10/13/21

- Led by: Kevin
- Present: Kevin, Karanveer, Brandon, Laszlo

## Action item

- a goal: A working MERN stack inside of the public repo
- a change: Communication outside of class time such as section and lectures
- a measurement: Measure how many times we touch base until the next sprint and compare it to the last sprint.

## Optional

- Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro
- Work and meetings don't have to happen during the lecture and can be done individually before we touch base
