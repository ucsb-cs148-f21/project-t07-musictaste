Meeting Time: lab01

Type of meeting: Sprint Planning

Team: Karanveer[x], Brandon[x], Laszlo[], Kevin[]
Brandon and Karanveer were at the section, while others made sure to communicate they could not make it to today's section.
There are some steps that the members who couldn't make it need to complete:
-Join the organization
-Potentially set up github if it is not already set up.
-Make a personal .md file and create a pr for the lab.
Need to discuss some features we want to include but these could be added as we go. Rather a general direction needs to be agreed upon so we can start working and we will finetune it as we go.
