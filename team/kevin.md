Hello! My name is Kevin Tran, and I think a music app that focuses on collaboration to build playlists would fulfill a nice niche.
While collaborative playlists do already exist on other platforms like Spotify, an app with the main purpose of building
collaborative playlists along with rating others' playlists and suggesting changes would fulfill a niche that has yet
to be filled. Some key features might include:

- Build publicly viewable playlists with peers
- View, rate, and comment on others' playlists
- Public profiles for each user that display playlist contributions, favorite artists/albums, most collaborated with friends, favorite genres of music, listening habits
- Private messaging/group chats for discussion surrounding the creation of playlists/song choices
